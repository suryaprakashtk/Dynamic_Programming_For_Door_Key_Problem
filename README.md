# Dynamic Programming For Door Key Problem
## Overview
This project is a part of coursework Planning and Learning in Robotics done in Spring 2023.

This code models the standard door key problem as a Markov Decision Process and solve it using Dynamic Programming Algorithm. The problem is split as 2 parts. The objective for both parts is to implement a Dynamic
Programming algorithm that minimizes the cost of reaching the goal. Mathematically,

$$
min V_t^{\pi}\left ( x \right ):= q\left ( x_T \right )+\sum_{\tau =t}^{T-1}l\left ( x_{\tau},\pi_t\left ( x_\tau \right ) \right )
$$

## Part A:
Standard maps of size 5x5, 6x6 and 8x8 is given with random goal and key position. The placement of them is also given as input in the environment variable. There will only be one door which might or might not block the path to the key. The goal is to run DP on every input map and find an optimal path sequence. Example of the map is given below:
|           doorkey-5x5           |            doorkey-6x6            |            doorkey-8x8            |

## Part B:
We are given a set of 36 environments and run DP once which computes one general policy for all the environment.

## Results
Some of the results obtained are shown below:
|          doorkey-5x5                |          doorkey-6x6                   |            doorkey-8x8                 |
